The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086010;ieee explore;"V.

1;1;8;white;The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on firms: a survey in Guangdong Province, China;nan;nan;"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors of the world economy and society. To understand the impact of the pandemic on firms in China and suggest public policies to deal with the negative effects, we investigated firms in Guangdong Province.

Methods
The survey sample included 524 firms in 15 cities in Guangdong Province. We chose these firms from the list published by the government, considering the industrial characteristics of Guangdong province and firm size. The questionnaire was developed based on previous studies carried out by UNDP. It comprised four categories with a total of 17 questions. The executives of firms were contacted by telephone or WeChat, and were invited to answer self-administered questionnaires through an online survey platform. The data was analyzed by SPSS.

Results
The following key findings were revealed through the survey: (1) 48.7% of firms maintained stability, and 35.1% experienced a halt in operation or faced closure; (2) Nearly 70–90% already exploit online commerce or are willing to do so, and also remote office work, and digital operations. (3) 46% believe that they will certainly incur losses for 2020, and 83.5% expect the city’s GDP to decrease.

This study investigates the effects of the pandemic on developers’ wellbeing and productivity.

Method
A questionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales and translated into 12 languages. The data was analyzed using non-parametric inferential statistics and structural equation modeling.

Results
The questionnaire received 2225 usable responses from 53 countries. Factor analysis supported the validity of the scales and the structural model achieved a good fit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Confirmatory results include: (1) the pandemic has had a negative effect on developers’ wellbeing and productivity; (2) productivity and wellbeing are closely related; (3) disaster preparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office ergonomics all affect wellbeing or productivity. Exploratory analysis suggests that: (1) women, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected; (2) different people need different kinds of support.

Conclusions
To improve employee productivity, software companies should focus on maximizing employee wellbeing and improving the ergonomics of employees’ home offices. Women, parents and disabled persons may require extra support. ; http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09875-y";True;False;False;False;True;False;True;False;False;True;False;True;0.08;0.0;0.21;0.26;0.46;Fear;Monday

The panel discussed the impact of COVID-19 on knowledge workers, the acceleration of digital workplace transformation, and anticipated long term effects from the pandemic in the context of agile practices. Four key observations emerged from the discussion: First, virtual collaboration between those working from home is enabled by a variety of communication tools – substituting for face-to-face interactions. Second, agile work practices are harder to perform given the virtual nature of meetings and interactions. Third, communication tools are not always adequate for high-bandwidth or informal interactions, such as brainstorming, side discussions, or hallway conversations.

Every person ranging from older people, persons with disabilities, youth, indigenous people have become a part of this chain and are most likely to suffer in the upcoming chronology. Social distancing is likely to become a new norm where “Work from Home”, Online Lectures” and “Meetings” ensue on social media applications. Technology has always lent a helping hand for mankind's problems. The idea focuses on highlighting the advancements in technology in the midst of a bizarre situation. Deep Learning applications to detect the symptoms of COVID-19, AI based robots to maintain social distancing, Blockchain technology to maintain patient records, Mathematical modeling to predict and assess the situation and Big Data to trace the spread of the virus and other technologies. These technologies have immensely contributed to curtailing this pandemic.

An Approach to Cybersecurity, Cyberbullying in Social Networks and Information Security in Public Organizations during a Pandemic: Study case COVID-19 Ecuador The problems of cybersecurity, cyberbullying in social networks worldwide are persistent and increasingly evident and prejudicial to society regardless of age or sex; during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ecuador study case can show negative and psychological impacts; another of the radical problems is the information security of public organizations for strategic decision making in natural or anthropogenic disasters in Ecuador, has caused serious problems to generate public policies with effectiveness and efficiency in health, education, basic services among others. The objective of the study is to identify cybersecurity problems, cyberbullying in social networks and present alternatives to improve information security in public organizations during a pandemic. It was used deductive method and exploratory research were to analyze the information. Turned out the early evaluation in the identification of cyberattack, cyberbullying and positive, negative and psychological impacts of the use of social networks during the pandemic and a prototype of a National System of Public Data Registration based on Blockchain to improve management of risks against natural or anthropogenic disasters in Ecuador. It was concluded that for making decisions effectively, efficiently at the strategic level during a pandemic such as COVID-19 or any other natural disaster, the most important thing in the first instance is to have information with integrity, to carry out adequate planning according to the reality of each country. ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240375";True;False;False;False;False;False;False;False;False;True;False;True;0.08;0.08;0.06;0.25;0.53;Fear;Monday

GitLab has no physical office and its employees can work from anywhere they choose. Any step of the organizational life of a GitLab employee (e.g., hiring, onboarding and firing) is performed remotely, except for a yearly companywide gathering. GitLab strongly relies on asynchronous coordination, allowing employees to work anytime they want.
