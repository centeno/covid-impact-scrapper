Resilient power utility system is the need of the hour to revive the economy. Distribution systems across many parts of the globe have the problem of high system loss, high voltage unbalance and poor maintenance of system voltage profile. In this paper the major aim in allocating Distributed Generation (DG) and DSTATCOM is to reduce line loss, decrease voltage unbalance and to maintain the voltage profile in the practical unbalanced distribution system. Improvement of these system performance parameters will in turn enhance the system resilience. Improved Particle Swarm Optimization based on success rate (IPSO-SR) is chosen as the optimization algorithm to solve the planning problem. Security constraints of voltage profile, power factor and power flow were considered in the problem. To validate the proposed methodology IEEE 37 bus feeder which is a real 4.8 KV feeder of California is chosen. The system performance is analyzed for residential load demand as per its growing demand in current pandemic situation. Open Distribution system simulator software (Open DSS) is used for three phase unbalanced power flow analysis of the network. Result of the work validates the effectiveness of this approach.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9376508";"ieee explore";"R. Bonela; S. R. Ghatak; N. Hayat; S. C. Swain; A.

A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly (World Health Organization, 2020). In the early days of March 2020, institutions of higher education worldwide began a sudden closure of face-to-face instruction to transition to remote teaching. This transition occurred in a matter of days, disrupting educational and administrative operations. The rapid spread pandemic caught many at colleges and universities by surprise and triggered the implementation of strategies to provide continuity of instruction (Morales, 2019). From faculty training to course creation and from student support to the creation of on-the-fly work from home policies (WFH). The abrupt change also brought to the surface the relevance of training, support systems, and academic continuity planning at an institution serving more than 100,000 students annually.

To understand the impact of the pandemic on firms in China and suggest public policies to deal with the negative effects, we investigated firms in Guangdong Province.

Methods
The survey sample included 524 firms in 15 cities in Guangdong Province. We chose these firms from the list published by the government, considering the industrial characteristics of Guangdong province and firm size. The questionnaire was developed based on previous studies carried out by UNDP. It comprised four categories with a total of 17 questions. The executives of firms were contacted by telephone or WeChat, and were invited to answer self-administered questionnaires through an online survey platform. The data was analyzed by SPSS.

Results
The following key findings were revealed through the survey: (1) 48.7% of firms maintained stability, and 35.1% experienced a halt in operation or faced closure; (2) Nearly 70–90% already exploit online commerce or are willing to do so, and also remote office work, and digital operations. (3) 46% believe that they will certainly incur losses for 2020, and 83.5% expect the city’s GDP to decrease.

Conclusions
Firms in Guangdong Province have faced great challenges in the epidemic. Their production and operation activities have been limited, and they are facing significant risks. It is necessary to implement policies that would profoundly lower production costs for firms, help them survive this difficult period, and gradually return to normal business.";"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41256-020-00166-z";"springer";"Peng ZouDi HuoMeng Li";"Global Health Research and Policy";"92 Xidazhi St, Nangang, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China";1;0;1;1;1;0;"NA";"produtividade;e-commerce;trabalho remoto;transformação digital;financeiro;inovação;colaboração;financiamento";"produtividade;e-commerce;trabalho remoto;transformação digital;financeiro;inovação;colaboração;financiamento";"mista";"NA";"misto";;2020;"Article";"2020-09-02"

We aim to understand how the queries are structured and their timing on the various platforms that citizens are using to check the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) since the outbreak of the COVID-19 public health crisis. Understanding and analyzing peak volume for information platforms is critical, especially for public health policy, with a mind toward crisis informatics. In this study, we collect all the data of users querying data from Face Mask Map (FMM), a real-time application which displays the inventory status for all stores selling PPE. This data is from the point at which the public health crisis became widely known to the time at which PPE availability saturated the market. As COVID-19 continues to proliferate and affect people around the globe, official organizations such as Department of Health and World Health Organization (WHO) utilize Web or Social Media (Facebook or Twitter) to announce up-to-date news, e.g. daily confirmed cases or in order to update policy regarding resource management. We then correlate the significant announcements from public health officials, specifically published by Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) in Taiwan, that are concerning usage and distribution of PPE. We find that the temporal dynamics of aggregated users behavior are consistent with the events. For the practitioner of disaster management, it is critical to be able to identify when the public will consistently react to public health announcements for the purpose of ensuring proper supply distribution and avoid misallocation.

This study investigates the effects of the pandemic on developers’ wellbeing and productivity.

Method
A questionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales and translated into 12 languages. The data was analyzed using non-parametric inferential statistics and structural equation modeling.

Results
The questionnaire received 2225 usable responses from 53 countries. Factor analysis supported the validity of the scales and the structural model achieved a good fit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Confirmatory results include: (1) the pandemic has had a negative effect on developers’ wellbeing and productivity; (2) productivity and wellbeing are closely related; (3) disaster preparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office ergonomics all affect wellbeing or productivity. Exploratory analysis suggests that: (1) women, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected; (2) different people need different kinds of support.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, infected people with no symptoms must isolate theirself to keep the virus from spreading. Medical devices connected to internet can be used for physiological measurement such as heart rates, blood oxygen saturation and body temperature and send the measurement result to a server. Remote monitoring can also reduce patient visit to hospital and therefore reduce workload of medical staff. In this research we propose a monitoring system for COVID-19 patients in self-isolation to monitor physiological data like SpO2 and heart rate together with location information of the patients. We have developed IoT-based health monitoring system with wireless body sensor networks and a gateway that can be used for data acquisition and transmission. The system also employed an application server that can be used for data storage, analytics, and visualization. The prototype of the monitoring system used home pulse oximeter for measuring SpO2 and heart rate and an Android application working as IoT gateway to collect data from sensor and adding location information before sending the data to server. In server, an open source Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (ELK) stack popular for logging and indexing large data continuously process incoming data so that medical staff can explore and visualize measurement results of patients and their location in a dashboard. That way they can monitor patient's condition trying to recover themselves in self-isolation at any time and take preventive actions as necessary.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328953";"ieee explore";"R.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease accompanied by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) [1], which is called a ""coronavirus"" for the visual similarity of the pathogen to the crown [2]. On April 23 2020, the World Health Organization has identified more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 virus disease [3]. Considering the scope of spread and features of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, timely diagnosis of the disease of citizens is important. The first step in developing any diagnostic or treatment tools is to effectively process data collections, much of which are based on open data from national, provincial, and municipal health facilities. At the same time, the importance of IT support the processes of making operational and strategic decisions in the health sector, as a critical area of smart cities and smart regions is increasing. Therefore, developing effective and reliable means of generating and processing detailed collections of COVID-19 outbreaks in real-time is an important research area in the implementation of innovative information technology projects of the smart city and smart region class. It requires design, development and implementation of information technology and software-algorithmic tools to collect and process data globally.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321889";"ieee explore";"O.

The application of contact tracing and moving object tracking is critical in applying pandemic control measures and is getting more important day by day. This work proposes a computer vision-based algorithm for contact tracing using stationary surveillance cameras. The input videos are converted into a bird's eye view where all moving objects are detected, and the distances between them are calculated. The algorithm performs background subtraction to isolate foreground objects, morphological operations to remove the noise, and blob analysis to identify the connected regions in the resulting foreground video. Kalman filters to estimate objects' motion in the video calculates Euclidean distance between the objects to trace object contacts. This algorithm can be utilized in almost all public places such as shopping malls, airport terminals, and educational institutions. It allows identifying, assessing, and managing people who might have been exposed to the disease. The testing data was collected in a home environment, and the stationary camera was replaced with a mobile phone camera fixed on a tripod. The work was implemented and tested, and the results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

To reconstruct the development trend of COVID-19, we investigate the issue of the epidemic spreading process under vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here, an improved Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model with dynamic variables (i.e., health exposure individuals and close contacts) is proposed to predict the scale of COVID-19 and its dynamic evolution. We assume that the number of contacts and the reproduction number of COVID-19 changes dynamically over time. Then a gradient descent method is applied to estimate the effective reproduction number. We use the proposed model to reconstruct the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 in Chongqing between 14 January and 24 March 2020.

The development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is difficult due to many obstacles, such as the lack of knowledge of important proteins, genes, and mutations of the viral genome. In this study, we selected and utilized 852 strains of COVID-19 from major countries in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) global virus bank. The information of these strains was processed by using Nextstrain software, a program that provided a visual phylogenetic tree, transmission map, and diversity panel that explains entropy and number of mutations for each codon in the genome. The general data about the spread and evolution of COVID-19 supported the current knowledge that it began in China and spread throughout the country in an interrelated manner instead of a clear “patient zero” manner. A recent study reported that codon 614 on COVID-19 spike protein (S614) was an important codon for viral spread, specifically, a mutation from aspartic acid to glycine facilitated the spread of the virus. Therefore, we chose to geographically track this mutation during the spread of COVID-19 to investigate where it emerged and whether it can affect the spread COVID-19. Our results showed that the glycine mutation first emerged in France. Also, the transmission rates in France versus China, where the mutation was not prevalent, did reflect the hypothesized change in viral behavior.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313091";"ieee explore";"M.

With the new normal here to stay for the recent future, employees have also adapted to different working environments and customs, which has also resulted in psychological stress and lethargy for many, as they adapt to the new normal and adjust their personal and professional lives. In this work, data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms have been used to predict employees stress levels. Based on data, we can develop a model that will assist to predict if an employee is likely to be under stress or not. Here, the XGB classifier is used for the prediction process and the results are presented showing that the method facilitates getting a more reliable model performance. After performing interpretation utilizing XGB classifier it is determined that working hours, workload, age, and, role ambiguity have a significant and negative influence on employee performance. The additional factors do not hold much significance when associated to the above discussed. Therefore, It is concluded that concluded that increasing working hours, role ambiguity, the workload would diminish employee representation in all perspectives.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9315726";"ieee explore";"A.

COVID-19 has been the most serious of these ones in terms of the number of people affected and the lives lost. In order to contain the spread of the disease many countries including Sri Lanka enforced 24 hour curfews. The social isolation created by lockdowns creates many problems in people including anxiety and depression. Many studies have been carried out on effect of lockdowns on mental well being of people. But, so far nobody has studied whether online social me can help people overcome the negative effects of lockdowns. This research was carried out to fill this gap. An online survey was carried out to understand how people used social media during the continuous curfew enforced by the Sri Lankan government. The research found that the average time spent using social media has increased compared to normal days. Also, majority of the users agreed that the social media helped them overcome the boredom created by the lockdown. This fact was confirmed using statistical tests in this study.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310846";"ieee explore";"M. F. M.

To agree to this limitation, governments are receiving limitations over the base between close to home separation between individuals. Given this real situation, it is critical to enormously gauge the consistence to such physical requirement in our life, so as to make sense of the purposes behind the potential breaks of such separation impediments and comprehend if this suggests a likely danger. To this end, the proposed research work presents the Video Social Distancing issue, characterized as the programmed assessment of the between close to home good ways from a picture, and the portrayal of related individuals' conglomerations. Video Social Distancing is significant for a non-obtrusive investigation of whether individuals follow the Social Distancing limitation, and to give insights about the degree of security of explicit territories at whatever point this imperative is abused. It has been first viewed that, estimating Video Social Distancing isn't just a mathematical issue, however it additionally infers a more profound comprehension of the social conduct in the scene. The point is to genuinely identify possibly risky circumstances while keeping away from bogus alerts (e.g., a family with youngsters or family members, a senior with their guardians), the entirety of this by following current security strategies. At that point, the proposed research work will discuss about how video social distancing is related with past writing in social signal processing and show a way to investigate new computer vision techniques that can give an answer for such issue.

Current research suggests that this trend will continue in the future. In parallel with the growth of the e-book market and the development of e-book library collections, librarians and information scientists have conducted a number of research studies to investigate the impact of e-books on collection development: specifically, relating to the challenges and questions of e-book management and service. Consequently, researchers have considered it pertinent to explore the behaviours and strategies of e-book readers. Scope: In January 2020, institutions around the globe faced significant disruption due to COVID-19. Many universities accelerated their adoption of online/e-learning approaches in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Though e-books were at an early stage of adoption and the culture of using them in academia was slowly growing, they suddenly became the preferred option, if not the sole option because libraries were closed. Accordingly, some of the popular publishers; for example, Cambridge University Press, have offered online higher education textbooks as free-to-access. Over 700 textbooks were available for more than 2 months, regardless of whether those textbooks had previously been purchased. Furthermore, MIT Press offered complimentary access to its catalogue of e-books to support faculty and students who were working and learning remotely. Methodology: Despite increasing interest from librarians and learning technologists, prior to 2020, there were few well conducted studies investigating the habits of e-book users, especially amongst engineering students. Notwithstanding the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, an opportunity has arisen to survey student attitudes regarding the adoption of e-reading in an academic context. In this paper, a case study is presented that investigates the impact of the mandatory use of an e-book textbook in a final year undergraduate engineering module at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. The paper investigates Science and Engineering students' usage and attitudes towards e-books when using their available e-readers, which include PCs or portable devices. A cross-sectional survey containing 5 nominal questions, 2 open questions and 17 Likert questions was developed and deployed to final year students from two programmes: Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering. These students were attending the module titled Integrated Circuits and Systems. Findings: The results of this study highlight approaches for improving support for e-reading in an academic environment Of particular interest to librarians are student attitudes after their adjustment to e-books, which have implications for future purchasing decisions. Furthermore, student strategies for adjusting their learning techniques as a result of forced engagement with e-books illustrate preferences that can inform educators. In conclusion, the forced adoption of e-books has presented the opportunity to investigate student acceptance and strategies. This research provides evidence for purchasing decisions and strategies for adopting e-books in wider Higher Education syllabi.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293649";"ieee explore";"S.

Commerce has stalled with travel, hospitality, education, retail, and health sectors particularly affected. This paper is based on an XP 2020 panel organized by Steven Fraser and featuring Aino Corry, Steve McConnell, and Rachel Reinitz. The panel discussed the impact of COVID-19 on knowledge workers, the acceleration of digital workplace transformation, and anticipated long term effects from the pandemic in the context of agile practices. Four key observations emerged from the discussion: First, virtual collaboration between those working from home is enabled by a variety of communication tools – substituting for face-to-face interactions. Second, agile work practices are harder to perform given the virtual nature of meetings and interactions. Third, communication tools are not always adequate for high-bandwidth or informal interactions, such as brainstorming, side discussions, or hallway conversations. Fourth, forming new teams and onboarding staff is challenging in a virtual work environment.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58858-8_32";"springer";"Dennis ManclSteven D.

The impact of COVID-19 is visible in many sectors, such as health, logistics, and many other critical aspects of our daily lives. Due to the continuous rapid spread of COVID-19, many countries have imposed lockdown measures. As a result of the lockdown, many organizations are devising measures to remain operational during this period and beyond. One of the visible challenges of the lockdown to organizations lies in their technological readiness strategies, to operate this period. One of the feasible responses, many organizations are implementing is allowing workers to work from home and long-distance learning. Technologies such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Video Conferencing can enable workers to work from home. During this period cloud service providers have also noticed a big rise in the usage of cloud-based solutions. On the other hand, due to cost-effectiveness and usability, the concept of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is rapidly gaining ground in the cloud and mobile computing communities. Cloud-based solutions, such as MCC can be deemed a possible solution to the damage that can be caused by the lockdown and beyond, to many organizations. Currently, however, there is no feasible MCC adoption model that guides the process of its adoption, thus the need to propose one. In this paper, an MCC adoption model is proposed, as well as a case scenario to which MCC can be useful is demonstrated.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288402";"ieee explore";"N.

Studies conducted by the “Roselectromontazh” Association have shown a significant difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity, which is further confirmed by the reports of electric grid companies. In some cases, there is a 3-fold difference. This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient devices. In 2019, the results of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standards of the Republic of Tatarstan. On average, the normative values have been reduced by 2 times. This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity. From 2020 onwards, leading construction companies in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date values to decrease utility services' construction costs. For power grid companies the savings consist of reduction of electrical energy losses and “locked electrical capacity” and the elimination of inefficient investments. It is important to note that specific values of electrical load were calculated taking into account summer and winter peaks in order to exclude the emergencies. However, it was impossible to predict a time when people would need to stay self-isolated at home to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019).

Institutions such as first responders can be affected by COVID-19 by temporary or permanent loss of their essential staff and resources and therefore loss of their carrying capacity. The gradual and partial loss of carrying capacity in combination with increased demand on first responder systems can potentially push these system towards their tipping point, and thus cause even more loss of capacity to respond to emergency situations. In addition to the increased mental and emotional pressure burdened on first responders due to the presence and dangers of the virus, emergency personnel such as police officers can experience increased workload and stress during the pandemic as well as exposure to symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals affected by COVID-19. By assessing the dynamic carrying capacity of the first responder systems and their interaction with the general population they provide service to, the resiliency of first responder systems can be assessed in face of various scenarios. The resiliency of first responder systems can be increased by designing extra capacity and preventing the system from coming into the proximity of its tipping point, which could result in partial or major collapse in performance of the system. Therefore, protecting the emergency personnel and these indispensable institutions as well as maintaining the capacity to respond to the majority of the emergency calls is paramount. Since the police force, hospitals, fire departments, and other care institutions are structures consisting of a wide range of individuals and operate in an ever-changing environment, this paper attempts to assess the resilience and capacity of such institutions via simulations to find and localize their tipping points. To enable such simulations, the model developed by Vierlboeck, Nilchiani, and Edwards [2] was extended with further branches to allow for simulations of sub-systems and loads thereof. For this paper, the police force of New York City (NYC) was chosen as a case study. To assess the police force performance, the capabilities and capacities of the sub-system were evaluated by testing its function under different circumstances and with different influencing factors such as fatigue [3] and the influence of the Yerkes-Dodsen Law [4]. This way, it was possible to assess the performance of the emergency personnel and provide information that could potentially be used for regulatory measures and decisions. The conducted evaluations and simulations studied the existing system's resiliency and its proximity to the system tipping point as the reduction of a number of emergency personnel is inevitable due to sickness caused by COVID-19. The baseline simulations showed performance drops under high loads which leaves the system in a more delicate state and vulnerable, with a higher tendency to collapse. Testing different scenarios, it was found that overall the system can tolerate a certain degree of changes in temporary demand. However, extended stress and increased demand on the emergency infrastructure systems can push them towards their tipping point and therefore cause irreversible damage.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272229";"ieee explore";"M.

The system has a logistics dispatch module and a video analytics module. The first module allows the delivery of medical, food, smoke, disinfectant, etc. The module is practical, safe and economical, features that denote the feasibility of immediate implementation in unmanned vehicles of any rank and / or classification. Note that the implementation of the dispatch module does not require additional radio frequency systems. The second module includes a video analysis process in real time, an aspect that constitutes a significant contribution to the proposed solution, since it allows obtaining important information during the flight; it also reduces the risk in air operations and simultaneously increases the efficiency of themselves. Note that video analytics optimizes resources and avoids jeopardizing the lives of aircraft pilots and crews who traditionally should carry out these activities. In times of pandemic, this innovation avoids direct contact with an infected population and can guarantee the sanitary conditions required in certain circumstances.

Although, RT-PCR is an effective technique for COVID-19 diagnosis, it requires expensive scarce equipment, reagents and specialized technicians. Chest radiological imaging, like X-ray and AI approaches can be useful to overcome some of the limitations. A deep learning model for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 is proposed in this research, based on a CNN with 3 incremental convolutional blocks and a full connected MLP, which requires raw chest X-ray images to return the probability of identifying the pneumonia caused by this virus, with a 98.2% of accuracy.

They commonly result in enormous economic losses, political disruptions, social unrest, and quickly evolve to a national security concern. Societies have been shaped by pandemics and outbreaks for as long as we have had societies. While differing in nature and in realizations, they all place the normal life of modern societies on hold. Common interruptions include job loss, infrastructure failure, and political ramifications. The electric power systems, upon which our modern society relies, is driving a myriad of interdependent services, such as water systems, communication networks, transportation systems, health services, etc. With the sudden shifts in electric power generation and demand portfolios and the need to sustain quality electricity supply to end customers (particularly mission-critical services) during pandemics, safeguarding the nation's electric power grid in the face of such rapidly evolving outbreaks is among the top priorities. This paper explores the various mechanisms through which the electric power grids around the globe are influenced by pandemics in general and COVID-19 in particular, shares the lessons learned and best practices taken in different sectors of the electric industry in responding to the dramatic shifts enforced by such threats, and provides visions for a pandemic-resilient electric grid of the future.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272968";"ieee explore";"B.

To help contain the impacts of COVID-19, universities and schools need to strongly shift to various electronic education models such as online learning, distance learning and blended learning. One of the crucial models that support the success of distance learning especially in engineering education is the remote-controlled experimentations, which allow students to execute the required practical work in a similar way as it conducted in the physical laboratories if it is appropriately designed. This paper introduces an integrated solution for improving the remotely controlled working on the educational laboratory experiments for electrical engineering sector. The proposed solution consists of four main components: Internet of remote-controlled things that represent the required experimentation devices, cloud platform, TCP/IP Internet communication connection, and finally the control and monitoring application. A complete experiment for phasor measurement unit (PMU) system as an example is deployed in the university laboratory with its all components which is completely controlled and managed remotely from the home through Internet. PMU is installed in a prototype of electrical substation with different types of loads.

Also, the unemployment scenario will be at its peak in the upcoming years as reported by UNGA. To combat this scenario, all the country are working on fostering their fiber network and so the sectors apart from the manufacturing, will tend to work from their home and contribute to the economy. But there are many problems arising to implement this culture practically, since it affects the mindsets of the people who have to endure this transformation within a very short span. Hence, in this research work, it has been decided to focus on this current issue for which the usage of certain apps in UAE such as zoom, totok, botim for internet calling have been identified since this is the only way of connectivity with the outside world. To perform this analysis, the tweets from December to July have been collected by converting the image to text and analyzed using two algorithms such as Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The sentimental analysis found that 630 tweets were positive and people in UAE feels secured, satisfied and internet calling is very useful for them in the prospect of work, education, etc. Only 48 tweets has negative impact because people feel little bit harder in sudden change of culture with in short period of time and 155 tweets has impact that both positive and negative were view and said to be natural. The study found that NB (84%) is more accurate, user friendly and takes less time than RNN (79%) to perform the analysis.

The aim of this study is to analyze the degree of satisfaction after using VCP in a sample of psychotherapists freely recruited through the publication on social media of a specially created questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed by performing descriptive statistics to show the qualitative and quantitative composition of the sample examined. A tree classification model was created to predict the liking of the remote therapeutic intervention based on the sociodemographic characteristics, previous experiences and aspects of psychotherapeutic orientation of the therapists recruited in the study. Through a decision tree that explains which variables are related to positive responses, the following characteristics were found to predict the degree of satisfaction of the psychotherapists in using the VCP: belonging to a specific age group; having previously used VCP; and belonging to a specific psychotherapeutic orientation. According to the results, the first two important characteristics of the psychotherapists to influence the satisfaction in their use of VCP (belonging to the specific age group 45-65 and having previously used VCP) are probably a matter that can be linked to the degree of professional maturity and experience.

Forecasts using mathematical-epidemiological models have played and continue to play an important role in assessing the probability of COVID-19 infection under specific conditions and are urgently needed to prepare health systems for coping with this pandemic. In many instances, however, access to dedicated and updated information, in particular at regional administrative levels, is surprisingly scarce considering its evident importance and provides a hindrance for the implementation of sustainable coping strategies. Here we demonstrate the performance of an easily transferable statistical model based on the classic Holt-Winters method as means of providing COVID-19 forecasts for India at different administrative levels. Based on daily time series of accumulated infections, active infections and deaths, we use our statistical model to provide 48-days forecasts (28 September to 15 November 2020) of these quantities in India, assuming little or no change in national coping strategies. Using these results alongside a complementary SIR model, we find that one-third of the Indian population could eventually be infected by COVID-19, and that a complete recovery from COVID-19 will happen only after an estimated 450 days from January 2020. Further, our SIR model suggests that the pandemic is likely to peak in India during the first week of November 2020.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217468";"ieee explore";"R.

The IoT revolution is reshaping modern healthcare systems by incorporating technological, economic, and social prospects. It is evolving healthcare systems from conventional to more personalized healthcare systems through which patients can be diagnosed, treated, and monitored more easily. The current global challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. At the time this paper was written, the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases around the world had reached more than 31 million. Since the pandemic started, there has been a rapid effort in different research communities to exploit a wide variety of technologies to combat this worldwide threat, and IoT technology is one of the pioneers in this area. In the context of COVID-19, IoT-enabled/linked devices/applications are utilized to lower the possible spread of COVID-19 to others by early diagnosis, monitoring patients, and practicing defined protocols after patient recovery.

Especially after a `hard' disaster such as earthquakes or a `soft' disaster such as COVID-19 pandemic, the existing telecommunication infrastructure, including wired and wireless networks, is often seriously compromised or with infectious disease risks and should-not-close-contact, thus cannot guarantee regular coverage and reliable communications services. These temporarily-missing communications capabilities are crucial to rescuers, health-carers, or affected or infected citizens as the responders need to effectively coordinate and communicate to minimize the loss of lives and property, where the 5G/6G mobile edge network helps. On the other hand, the federated machine learning (FML) methods have been newly developed to address the privacy leakage problems of the traditional machine learning held normally by one centralized organization, associated with the high risks of a single point of hacking. After detailing current state-of-the-art both in privacy-preserving, federated learning, and mobile edge communications networks for `hard' and `soft' disasters, we consider the main challenges that need to be faced. We envision a privacy-preserving federated learning enabled buses-and-drones based mobile edge infrastructure (ppFL-AidLife) for disaster or pandemic emergency communications. The ppFL-AidLife system aims at a rapidly deployable resilient network capable of supporting flexible, privacy-preserving and low-latency communications to serve large-scale disaster situations by utilizing the existing public transport networks, associated with drones to maximally extend their radio coverage to those hard-to-reach disasters or should-not-close-contact pandemic zones.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9191668";"ieee explore";"B.

Creating unobtrusive remote monitoring tools for medical professionals that may aid in diagnosis, monitoring and contact tracing could lead to more efficient and accurate treatments, especially in this time of physical distancing. Audio based sensing methods can address this by measuring the frequency, severity and characteristics of the COVID-19 cough. However, the feasibility of accumulating coughs directly from patients is low in the short term. This article introduces a novel database (NoCoCoDa), which contains COVID-19 cough events obtained through public media interviews with COVID-19 patients, as an interim solution. After manual segmentation of the interviews, a total of 73 individual cough events were extracted and cough phase annotation was performed. Furthermore, the COVID-19 cough is typically dry but can present as a more productive cough in severe cases. Therefore, an investigation of cough sub-type (productive vs. dry) of the NoCoCoDa was performed using methods previously published by our research group. Most of the NoCoCoDa cough events were recorded either during or after a severe period of the disease, which is supported by the fact that 77% of the COVID-19 coughs were classified as productive based on our previous work. The NoCoCoDa is designed to be used for rapid exploration and algorithm development, which can then be applied to more extensive datasets and potentially real time applications.

It is critical to simultaneously formulate and adapt multiple strategic plans of individual ports to the above stressors. The Port of Virginia (POV) generates 400,000 jobs, or roughly 11% of jobs across Virginia, and has an overall annual economic impact of $92 billion. POV is currently investing $800 million to expand its annual container throughput capacity by 40 percent by the end of 2020. This investment supports initiatives outlined in the port's 2065 master plan through the investigation of different scenarios that impact emergent and future port conditions. This paper describes the most and least disruptive scenarios of emergent and future conditions, including hybrid scenarios involving the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree of disruption is measured by the changes in priorities of a port's strategic plan, in particular for the rank order of investments by their individual contributions to the strategic goals of the port. The analysis described herein includes sixteen strategic goals, 31 strategic plan investments, and several dozen emergent and future conditions. The analysis assembles the emergent conditions into scenarios. The most disruptive scenarios are selected for contingency planning, enterprise risk management, and research & development. Seven scenarios are available for future exploration in detail: (1) Funding Decrease (2) Natural Disaster (3) Green Technologies (4) Pandemic (5) Increased Automation (6) Alternative Financing (7) Population Changes. Green Technologies, Pandemic and Alternative Financing are explored in detail in this paper. The results of this paper are thus both a methodology for any port to address its emergent and future conditions via its strategic plans, and also a case study of enterprise resilience of a major container port of the United States.

However, it is difficult to extract situational requirements from numbers of conflicting sources. In this article, we propose a system that enables us to find out such useful information from social media and visualize it to understand the data easily. The system is divided into two steps. The first step is to extract requirements and issues from textual data, such as “We cannot buy gas here” or “We are short of batteries,” using natural language processing (NLP) technologies. The system also uses NLP to extract geolocation information, such as city names and location landmarks. The second step is to visualize the results in a timely and geolocated manner. We show the system results with using real Twitter data from the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016. By visualizing the information, the personnel in the disaster area, such as the local governments and/or volunteer organizations, can utilize this information very effectively.

The implementation and monitoring of international agreements, which are linked to the 2030 agenda (e.g., the Sendai Framework), require a standard set of metrics for internal displacement. Since nationally owned, validated, and credible data are difficult to obtain, new approaches are needed. This article aims to support the monitoring of displacement via satellite-derived observations of nighttime lights (NTL) from NASA's Black Marble product suite along with an short message service (SMS)-based emergency survey after Cyclone Idai had made landfall in Beira, Mozambique, in March 2019. Under certain conditions, the spatial extent of power outages can serve as a proxy for disaster impacts and a potential driver for displacement. Hence, information about anomalies in NTL has the potential to support humanitarian decision-making via estimations of people affected or the coordination of rapid response teams. Despite initial issues related to cloud cover, we find that around 90% of Beira's power grid had been affected. In collaboration with the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, we use these findings to establish a framework that links NTL observations with existing humanitarian decision-making workflows to complement ground-based survey data and other satellite-derived information, such as flood or damage maps.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906214";"ieee explore";"M.

This article presents a psychological model of risk communications that demonstrates how cognitive structure, cultural schema, and environment awareness could be combined to improve risk communication. We illustrate the explanatory value of the model's usefulness on two qualitative case studies: one on decision-makers facing extreme heat, and another on homeowners facing flood events. Consistent with the model predictions, we find that cognitive structure, cultural schema, and environment awareness dynamics are not only necessary determinants to strengthen risk communications, but also important for understanding perceptions of risk and people's (in)action to engage in mitigation and adoption efforts. This suggests that decision-makers hoping to reduce disaster risk or improve disaster resilience may wish to consider how these three dynamics exist and interact.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8894372";"ieee explore";"T.

"white";"Predicting impacts of weather-driven urban disasters in the current and future climate";;"Predictive models;Data models;Weather forecasting;Urban areas;Storms;Computational modeling";"Effective city operations depend on local weather conditions at the scale of critical urban infrastructure such as power and water distribution systems. This includes both routine and severe weather events. For example, with precipitation events, local topography and weather influence water runoff and infiltration, which directly affect flooding as well as drinking water quality and availability. The impact of such events creates issues of public safety. Thus, the availability of highly localized weather model predictions focused on public safety and operations of infrastructure can mitigate the impact of severe weather. This is especially true if the lead time for the availability of such predictions enables proactive allocation and deployment of resources to minimize recovery time from severe events. Typically, information at such a scale is simply not available. Hence, the ability of municipalities to proactively respond to these events is limited. Available continental- or regional-scale weather models are not appropriately matched to the temporal or spatial scale of such operations. While near-real-time assessment of observations of current weather conditions may have the appropriate geographic locality, by its very nature it is only directly suitable for reactive response. To address this gap, we use state-of-the-art physical weather models at the spatial scale of the city's infrastructure to avoid this mismatch in predictability. Model results are coupled to data-driven stochastic models to represent the actionable prediction of weather (business) impacts. In some cases, an intermediate physical model may be required to translate predicted weather into the phenomena that lead to such impacts. We have applied these ideas to several cities with a diversity of impacts and weather concerns and show how this coupled model methodology enables prediction of storm impacts on local infrastructure. We also discuss how this concept can be extended to a climate scale in order to evaluate the potential localized impacts of a warming planet and the effectiveness of strategies being used to mitigate such impacts.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8865409";"ieee explore";"L.

However, road network edges can be damaged or blocked by debris. Since response time is crucial, relief operations may start before knowing which edges are blocked. A blocked edge is revealed online when it is visited at one of its end-nodes. Multiple first-responder teams, who can communicate the blockage information, gather initially at an origin node and are assigned to target destinations (nodes) in the disaster-affected area. We consider multiple teams assigned to one destination. The objective is to find an online travel plan such that at least one of the teams finds a route from the origin to the destination in minimum time. This problem is known as the online multi-agent Canadian traveler problem. We develop an effective online heuristic policy and test it on real city road networks as well as randomly generated networks leading to instances with multiple blockages. We compare the performance of the online strategy with the offline optimum and obtain an average competitive ratio of 1.164 over 70,100 instances with varying parameter values.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8865230";"ieee explore";"D.

Elderly people are generally vulnerable to hazards and emergency situations. The proposed framework aims at developing an Internet of Things (IoT)-based intelligent, protective ecosystem for elderly that calls for help in emergencies such as floods, earthquakes, home fires, volcanic eruptions, and storms. This disaster system makes use of a range of calamity sensors in conjunction with in-house activities of the elderly subject. In the case of mishappening, the disaster relief authorities, community members, and other stakeholders will be instantly informed. All these sensors are powered through an uninterrupted electricity supply system, which will continue to work even in the case of power outages. The work carried out in this article is deeply inspired by the need to have holistic platforms that ensure a low-cost, robust, and responsive disaster alert system for the elderly (DASE) in place. Our objective is to overcome many of the shortcomings in the existing systems and offer a reactive disaster recovery technique.

"white";"Creating a water risk index to improve community resilience";;"Hazards;Indexes;Buildings;Economics;Finance;Sensitivity;Government";"Flood risk reduction is an existent discourse and agenda in policy and insurance. Existing approaches such as linking hydrological models to economic loss models may be highly inequitable between areas of different socio-economic vulnerability. To our knowledge, no one has tried to adapt the more advanced known heat risk theory by first informing flood risk with the socio-economic vulnerability, and then investigating the sensitivity of risk reduction policies to that flood risk. In this article, we demonstrate two methods to combine water hazard data with a derived water vulnerability index to characterize water risk. We then compare the costs of two potential government policies: buyout of the home versus funding for foundation elevation. We use the case study area of Pittsburgh, PA, which faces severe precipitation and riverine flooding hazards. We find that while small differences in characterizing flood risk can result in large differences between flood risk maps, the cost of the flood risk reduction policy is not sensitive to the method of representing the socio-economic vulnerability. This suggests that while validation of flood risk incorporating socio-economic data is needed, for some policies, policymakers can prioritize environmental justice with little to no additional cost.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859244";"ieee explore";"K.

In this article, we construct multiproduct supply chain network models for multiple humanitarian organizations. The models capture uncertainty associated with costs of their supply chain activities, including procurement, storage, and distribution, under multiple disaster scenarios, along with uncertainty associated with the demand for the disaster relief products at the demand points. The models reflect the organizations’ operations, without and with cooperation, with the humanitarian organizations seeking to determine the disaster relief multiproduct flows that minimize their expected total cost and risk, subject to expected demand satisfaction. We utilize a mean-variance approach to capture the risk associated with cost uncertainty and propose a synergy measure for the assessment of the potential strategic advantages of cooperation for resilient disaster management.

Recently, using high-frequency ventilators have been shown to reduce the risk of lung injury through low-volume airflow. However, the machines used today remain bulky, costly, and only for use in hospital settings. To provide intermediate therapy for patients between hospitalization and complete discharge, a portable, light-weight high-frequency ventilator is an urgent need. This work presents the design of a portable high-frequency ventilator and a study of its practicality for further clinical medical applications. Through the integration of advanced electronics and mechanical instruments, we develop a portable high-frequency ventilator with reconfigurable oxygen flow rate, applied pressure, and air volume for the needs of individual patients. A miniaturized portable high-frequency ventilator with digital controller and feedback system for stabilization and precision control is implemented.

In this paper we focus on the usage of a Machine Learning algorithm as an advantageous computational system aimed to support fast and effective decisions in epochs where a flu virus has initialized its spreading in a large or middle- size city. For this end the algorithm uses the formalism of the Wiener series that allows us to estimate predictions and thus manage decisions through these computational methodologies. In order to test the efficiency of the algorithm we used the 2009 Peruvian data where the flu A(H1N1) was spreading in Lima city with a velocity of 40 cases per week. We present simulations by which the usage of Machine Learning algorithms might be of importance to minimize undesired errors and optimize resources of public health services on those epochs where the velocity of spreading and number of contagious reaches their top values.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666474";"ieee explore";"H.

These solutions need to be customized for different geographical locations with different capabilities and should be produced quickly and at massive scales to meet the specific demands of the disasters. To complicate matters further, several government policies and industry guidelines regulate the deployment and use of such solutions. It is virtually impossible to handcraft the needed solutions individually and manually. A factory model is needed to rapidly build highly customized solutions very much like the auto factories that build millions of highly customized cars to satisfy needed safety requirements. In the same vein, this paper presents initial results from a software factory in the cloud that has produced a Smart Global Village (SGV) with more than 700 smart hubs for 130 countries that span 12 sectors, including disaster management. These highly customized smart hubs, created by using the SPACE Factory in less than 20 minutes per hub, also collaborate with each other that leads to highly creative B2B collaborations at global level.

However, these work settings introduce new intricacies in worker behaviors. The overlap between work and home can disrupt performance. The lack of social interaction can affect motivation. This elicits a need to implement novel methods to evaluate and enhance remote worker functioning. The potential to unobtrusively and automatically assess such workers can be fulfilled by social media and ubiquitous technologies. This paper situates recent research in the new context by extending our insights for increased remote interaction and online presence. We present implications for proactive assessment of remote workers by understanding day-level activities, coordination, role awareness, and organizational culture. Additionally, we discuss the ethics of privacy-preserving deployment, employer surveillance, and digital inequity. This paper aims to inspire pervasive technologies for the new future of work.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319340";"ieee explore";"V. Das Swain; K. Saha; G. D. Abowd; M.

"white";"The Impact of the COVID Crisis on the Innovative Potential of China’s Internet Platforms";;"Internet platforms; digital innovation; China; knowledge-intensive online services; technology diffusion; COVID-19 pandemic";"Although the COVID-19 crisis has hit the Chinese economy hard, China’s Internet companies have benefited from the quarantine. However, the long-term consequences of the 2020 crisis for the development of the innovative potential of Chinese Internet corporations, primarily the largest platforms such as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and JD.com as integrators of the Chinese Internet economy, are still unclear. This article provides a general overview of changes in the consumption of services of large platforms, including moderate growth in demand, strengthening of the segment of high-tech services (cloud solutions for business, digital healthcare, etc.), digitalization of small and medium enterprises, and expansion of the user audience. The innovative and technological initiatives of the platforms are analyzed. Within the framework of the announced state plans, large platforms, in partnership with regional authorities, business, and universities, intend to develop an advanced digital infrastructure (5G, data centers, etc.) and innovation infrastructure (digital clusters, technology parks, and research centers). Despite the lack of new breakthrough initiatives, the innovation capacity of the platforms is expected to strengthen in the long term.

Presumably, the key role will be played by qualitative changes in the markets owing to the diffusion of digital technologies and competences, which will lead to an increase in demand for Internet innovations. The mechanisms of transforming market changes into a resource for innovative development of the platforms are associated with the expansion of market data, the emergence of a complex system of services, and unique innovative ecosystems of the platforms, making it possible to organize and coordinate the innovative activities of various entities, as well as to coopt promising start-ups able to create breakthrough innovations during the crisis.";"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1019331620060271";"springer";"I.

With cloud technology becoming a larger and more important part of running a digital business, cloud computing (CC) platforms are rapidly limiting the effectiveness of the traditional security model. Since data and applications in the cloud reside the old enterprise boundaries, they must now be protected in new ways. As more and more users connect directly to the cloud applications, it is imperative to secure cloud assets to meet compliance, privacy and security requirements. Verification and key management are the key challenges within the cloud environment whereas trading the secret data. As of now, security is the main apprehension in the cloud security environment. In light of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 situation, telecomputing has now become a necessity for many businesses worldwide. As health concerns disrupt normal life and work patterns, businesses around the world have instituted mandatory Work-From-Home policies for millions of workers. Many employees will now be working outside of their corporate perimeter on a full-time basis for the immediate future and will need tools that enable them to securely share and handle sensitive corporate data. At CASB policies, we recognize that data security is now more important than ever and so to do our part to help companies now operating under a Work-From-Home policy. In this paper, we identified different new policies of CASB for securing data at work from home.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9337121";"ieee explore";"S. Ahmad; S.

In traditional courses conducting not only lectures but also practice, the instructor and teaching assistants walk around the class, check how the students are doing, find students who are having trouble, and guide them. However, in distributed education, it is difficult to do the same things as in a collocated environment; therefore, some measures are required. We have been conducting introductory software engineering education that applies web application development in addition to lectures. In the fully online implementation of this course, the following issues need to be considered: (1) the creation of a mechanism to mitigate problems regarding the building of a software engineering environment, and (2) the creation of a question and answer process during application development on a remote meeting system. This paper describes some solutions to the two issues.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9368334";"ieee explore";"Y. Yamada; K. Furukawa; A.

"white";"India’s Information Technology industry: prospects for growth and role in structural transformation";;"Exports; IT-BPM value chain; Job creation; Services-led growth";"The idea that service-sector industries, rather than manufacturing, can drive growth and structural change has caught the imagination of several scholars and policy-makers. For India, the Information Technology (IT) industry is often cited as an example of one such industry. However, empirical evidence for such claims is still weak. This article evaluates the Indian IT industry’s potential for growth. Most studies on the subject focus on the narrower segment of IT-Services in India while we take a holistic view and consider the potential of both software product and services, IT hardware, outsourced/offshored business processes, and activities involved in creation of intellectual property. We evaluate the present position and future prospects of the industry including India’s position in the technology value chain as well as future opportunities for the industry in the context of relocation of global manufacturing value chains and growth of the domestic market. We also discuss the likely impact of technology on jobs in the overall economy, direct and indirect job creation potential of the IT-BPM (Business Process Management) sector and the spill-over effects of technology as an enabler of new business models. Finally, we draw some lessons for effective industrial policy.";"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40622-020-00269-z";"springer";"Gaurav GuptaAmit Basole";"DECISION";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Article";

"white";"Study of Security and Privacy Issues in Internet of Things";"IoT;blockchain;architecture;security";"COVID-19;Privacy;Pandemics;Service-oriented architecture;Security;Internet of Things;Smart devices";"With the advancement of technology and the internet, almost every device is connected to internet. Internet of Things (IoT) can be explained as an extension of the internet in which smart devices are interconnected with each other. While each smart device has unique identifiers, which makes every device unique. Now, IoT has helped in developing smart architectures whether its home, healthcare, financial institutions or industries. There are smart devices everywhere. These smart devices can also communicate to each other in a network and they work together thus eliminating the need for human interaction. IoT is relatively new and is still developing rapidly. So, there are numerous privacy concerns in IoT. IoT can be divided into different architectural layers depending where the IoT is being used. The IoT model discussed in this research report is Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which is divided into three layers, application, Network and perception layer. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic the reliability on IoT has increased as people are working from home and many of the tasks has been automated using IoT. The number of security attacks on IoT has also been increased in 2020 alone, which has affected many IoT devices. The objective of this research report is to discuss a number of security and privacy challenges in IoT based on the three SOA layers, the objective of this report also covers discussion on the above mentioned three layers, different technologies used in each layer for communication and different attacks and methods which target each specific layer also discussing different security attacks on IoT which occur ed in 2020 during the COVID pandemic phase. This topic is chosen because Internet of Things is becoming important and is impacting everything around us. It is expected that the total number of IoT devices will cross 20 Billion in 2020 and will have an impact of more than $11 Trillion by 2025. Thus, the security of IoT is to be discussed.";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9371828";"ieee explore";"M. H. Khalid; M. Murtaza; M.

However, the introduction of DevOps-methods to organisations is a complex task. A successful introduction results in a set of structured process descriptions. Despite the structure, this process leaves margin for error: Especially security issues are addressed in individual stages, without consideration of the interdependence. Furthermore, applying DevOps-methods to distributed entities, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) is difficult as the architecture is tailormade for desktop and cloud resources. In this work, an overview of tooling employed in the stages of DevOps processes is introduced. Gaps in terms of security or applicability to the IoT are derived. Based on these gaps, solutions that are being developed in the course of the research project SCRATCh are presented and discussed in terms of benefit to DevOps-environments.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55583-2_20";"springer";"Simon D.

We model social and behaviour change communication intervention among other components of a water-sanitation-hygiene (WASH) system in response to the menace of open defecation in rural and urban communities globally. We also used experimental outcomes to show empirically that patterns in data captured in the WASH process could be learnt for effective decision making using deep learning neural networks as an intelligent software engineering technique. Eradicating open defecation is one of the indicators used for measuring progress made towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). We use the Adum-Aiona community in Nigeria as case study in designing community-based total sanitation programs using software model-driven engineering approaches with the aim of promoting their implementation. This is because even when toilets and other sanitary infrastructure are available, behavior and social change efforts are needed to promote their large-scale use. Also, we demonstrate that besides being used to model software systems, computational models (software architecture) are useful in documenting and promoting understanding of concepts in virtually all fields of human endeavour. Our motivation is that enhancing understanding of open defecation through software modelling would help SDG 6 implementors and actors attain set sanitation goals in both rural and urban communities towards the SDGs target year 2030.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58817-5_21";"springer";"Emmanuel OkewuSanjay MisraFernandez-Sanz Lius";"Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2020";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

To facilitate the adoption of agile methods and the further development of agile teams, the role of an agile coach has been introduced. However, this role has not been sufficiently explored from the perspective of those whose perform that role. To address this gap, we conducted a case study where we interviewed agile coaches with experiences from multiple companies. We identified the main objectives of agile coaches, the methods they use to achieve those objectives, the challenges they frequently face, the skills required by the role, and the value they provide to organizations and teams. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role and the construction of a professional identity. In addition, we offer a characterization that can be useful for professionals that are new in the role.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64148-1_3";"springer";"Kadri DaljajevEzequiel ScottFredrik MilaniDietmar Pfahl";"Product-Focused Software Process Improvement";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

"white";"Securing User eXperience: A Review for the End-Users’ Software Robustness";;"User eXperience; Usability; Security";"Millions of users all over the world nowadays spend many hours daily using social networks on a range of devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), in many languages and countries, under very different systems of governance, and in wide-ranging social, religious, cultural and political environments. But the same software (System Services, Operating Systems “OSes”, Hypervisors, Applications and Utilities) is still called upon to function in contexts defined by these vast differences in terms of quality, reliability, efficiency and security. All domestic appliances, contemporary cars and almost everything powered by electricity is now equipped with at least a rudimentary interface and ready-to-run software. Electronic transactions are now routine and there is a huge need for online security and privacy. Bring your own device (BYOD) is a trend that is appearing even in SMBs (Small and Midsize Business) with aspects, policy considerations, security models and traps. The success off all the above depends on User eXperience where the user intersects with the product (software). In this paper, we analyse the different approaches taken under the concept of User eXperience (UX) in tandem with the development of contemporary software, and examine their ramifications for the level of security and privacy. We will show that UX is a different concept from usability, examine the different academic approaches and their underlying viewpoints, and show how the tasks in question relate to security. We believe that the interface between UX and security is a demanding area which requires research in multiple dimensions. The need for designing and developing contemporary software which is smart, user-friendly, adaptive, secure and capable of protecting every type of user is immense.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57404-8_21";"springer";"Panagiotis ZagourasChristos Kalloniatis";"Human Aspects of Information Security and Assurance";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

"white";"IoT-Based Remote Control Study of a Robotic Trans-Esophageal Ultrasound Probe via LAN and 5G";;;"A robotic trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe has been recently developed to address the problems with manual control in the X-ray environment when a conventional probe is used for interventional procedure guidance. However, the robot was exclusively to be used in local areas and the effectiveness of remote control has not been scientifically tested. In this study, we implemented an Internet-of-things (IoT)-based configuration to the TEE robot so the system can set up a local area network (LAN) or be configured to connect to an internet cloud over 5G. To investigate the remote control, backlash hysteresis effects were measured and analysed. A joystick-based device and a button-based gamepad were then employed and compared with the manual control in a target reaching experiment for the two steering axes. The results indicated different hysteresis curves for the left-right and up-down steering axes with the input wheel’s deadbands found to be 15° and 8°, respectively. Similar magnitudes of positioning errors at approximately 0.5° and maximum overshoots at around 2.5° were found when manually and robotically controlling the TEE probe. The amount of time to finish the task indicated a better performance using the button-based gamepad over joystick-based device, although both were worse than the manual control. It is concluded that the IoT-based remote control of the TEE probe is feasible and a trained user can accurately manipulate the probe. The main identified problem was the backlash hysteresis in the steering axes, which can result in continuous oscillations and overshoots.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-60334-2_17";"springer";"Shuangyi WangXilong HouJames HousdenZengguang HouDavinder SinghKawal Rhode";"Medical Ultrasound, and Preterm, Perinatal and Paediatric Image Analysis";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

"white";"Designing a Sourcing Ecosystem for Strategic Innovation Through “Big Data” Applications";;"Sourcing configuration; Sourcing ecosystem; Cloud services; Innovation in outsourcing/offshoring; Big data; Artificial intelligence; Secondary markets; “Gig” economy ";"Published research on innovation from Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (ITO/BPO) is rare [1]. Strategic innovation involves high uncertainties better addressed through agile methods and a collaborative approach [1, 2, 3]. Key success factors in delivering ITO/BPO innovation are high-quality relationships, trust and collaborative cultures [1, 2, 3, 4], and establishing an effective governance configuration. The authors report on longitudinal case studies of a global mining company (“GMC”) and a group of its suppliers aimed at understanding how GMC is developing “big data” applications to generate game-changing innovation. This paper describes how GMC has developed a “big data” platform to support internal staff, customers, consultants and third party suppliers to create applications that can transform global mining and smelting industries to deliver a price premium for GMC’s products. GMC has encountered a shortage of suitably experienced data scientists in its key operating locations resulting in a significant skills gap in its big data program. GMC’s sourcing strategy aims to build an open and collaborative ecosystem that draws upon secondary markets to help fill the skills gap. To create an environment in which open innovation [5] can flourish, GMC established an Analytics Speed Team (AST) as an internal consulting and program management group to drive faster progress with big data applications. A contribution of this research is to identify the role of AST in establishing an effective governance configuration for open innovation. A practical contribution is made by analysing the value of secondary markets for ITO services in a sourcing ecosystem optimised for delivering innovation.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66834-1_10";"springer";"Kevan PenterBrian PerrinJohn WrefordGraham Pervan";"Digital Technologies for Global Sourcing of Services";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

In process frameworks like Scrum or similar ones some activities are in fact quite structured and need specific tool support. Hence, it is interesting to study the combination of specific agile practices with OSS tools.

In this paper we introduce the Compositional Agile System (CAS), an environment created to support iAgile and automate some of its tasks using OSS tools. iAgile is a Scrum-like model designed to develop critical systems in the military domain .";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47240-5_15";"springer";"Paolo CiancariniMarcello MissiroliFrancesco PoggiDaniel Russo";"Open Source Systems";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

"white";"Cyber Security Education and Training Delivering Industry Relevant Education and Skills via Degree Apprenticeships";;;"The rise of Digital Transformation, global pandemics, and AI, have made Cyber skills crucial in today’s world. Organisation flexibility can only be achieved when they have a strong foundation of Cyber professionals that can look after vulnerabilities and protect their systems. A multitude of evidence suggests that the economy is being held back due to a skills gap, particularly in the Cyber Security discipline. In seeking to reduce this gap, the UK government has extended a long established ‘apprenticeship’ programme to include degrees. Higher Education Degree Apprenticeships offer a cost-effective route for employers to upskill their staff and for apprentices to access free education (and a degree) whilst being paid. Each of the Degree Apprenticeships has an associated framework that defines core learning requirements – devised and created by a collaborative effort of industry and academia. How this framework is implemented however is very much up to individual institutions.

This paper presents an implementation of the Cyber Security Analyst degree apprenticeship undertaken at a UK Institution. Amongst the first in the UK to operationalise the standard, the approach has pragmatically dealt with a wide range of issues to create an academically rigorous yet commercially viable solution for industry. The paper presents the approach, demonstrates the academic rigor through mapping to industry-accepted standards, and discusses the collaborative role of the employer and University in providing a holistic and complete learning experience. The paper concludes by offering a critical discussion on challenges and opportunities and suggests ways employers and professional bodies can collaborate further with Higher Education in developing Degree Apprenticeships that will only be about skills, but also lifelong learning.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57404-8_14";"springer";"Ismini Vasileiou";"Human Aspects of Information Security and Assurance";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

The purpose of this paper is to introduce the fundamental problems related to hardware security and trust to audiences who do not necessarily have hardware design background. In order to do that, we first discuss the evolving roles of hardware in security from an enable to an enhancer and now an enforcer as it get involves more and more in system security. Then we review the following key problems in hardware security, physical attacks, side channel analysis, intellectual property protection, hardware Trojan, hardware security primitives, and applications in security and trust. We provide a novel view of these problems and the corresponding solutions from the perspective of information battle between the attackers and designers, where we consider three types of information: data collected, processed, and stored by the hardware; information hidden in the design as watermark, fingerprint, and Trojans; and the chip fabrication variations that can be extracted and utilized. It is interesting to see how the hardware security and trust problems can be unified under this framework of information battle (stealing and protection). Unfortunately, there are more unknowns and challenges than what we have discovered on this framework as we illustrated in the section of open problems. However, the emerging Internet of Things and cyber physical systems have provided a large application field for researchers and practitioners to work on hardware based lightweight security.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64793-3_27";"springer";"Gang Qu";"Decision and Game Theory for Security";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

We draw on the business model canvas framework and we examine the role of information technology in the business models of leading fintech startups in the New York City fintech ecosystem. We find that information technology plays a key role across nearly all components of the business models, orchestrating resources and processes to efficiently deliver personalized financial services to customers. Focusing on the IT-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-44999-5_26";"springer";"Stanislav Mamonov";"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

The impact of daily activities of humans in the city is presently very evident. The geographical and social characteristics of the cities may react and facilitate the sustainability as well as may really influence how the city may be more or less resilient to certain pollution production. After investigating the theoretical concept of Smart Sustainable City (SSC), this paper reported the work performed in supporting the aforementioned trend and analysis in three European cities (Florence, Helsinki and Cagliari) that despite having different characteristics for population and density, have some similarities, such as geomorphic aspects. In addition, two of them present a relevant port (Helsinki and Cagliari), two of them have similar urban complexity, such as traffic (Florence and Helsinki). The work presented has exploited Snap4City big data for smart city infrastructure and has been developed in the context of Snap4City, Trafair, and GHOST projects. The results have shown that critical aspects have been identified over time for pollution issues, in particular with PM10 and NOX.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58820-5_30";"springer";"Chiara GarauPaolo NesiIrene PaoliMichela PaolucciPaola Zamperlin";"Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2020";;1;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Chapter";

The type and characteristics of behavioral patterns used for the analysis were demonstrated. The authors conducted an experiment aimed at obtaining statistical information from investigated objects. During the experiment, a sample of signal trace patterns was obtained for the states under consideration. The approach based on the k-means clustering method was considered as the decisive identification rule. The approach to identifying the state of Industry 4.0 devices in information systems based on the processing of digitized sequences was proposed. The overall accuracy of the selected method was found to be 98%. The main limitations of the proposed approach are the need of formalization and selecting data groups for the formation of behavioral patterns. The basic advantage of the proposed approach is the relative ease of its implementation and minimum requirements for computing resources.";"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-65726-0_11";"springer";"Mikhail E.

Many did so on short notice, under difficult and stressful conditions. Objective: This study investigates the effects of the pandemic on developers’ wellbeing and productivity. Method: A questionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales and translated into 12 languages. The data was analyzed using non-parametric inferential statistics and structural equation modeling. Results: The questionnaire received 2225 usable responses from 53 countries. Factor analysis supported the validity of the scales and the structural model achieved a good fit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Confirmatory results include: (1) the pandemic has had a negative effect on developers’ wellbeing and productivity; (2) productivity and wellbeing are closely related; (3) disaster preparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office ergonomics all affect wellbeing or productivity. Exploratory analysis suggests that: (1) women, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected; (2) different people need different kinds of support. Conclusions: To improve employee productivity, software companies should focus on maximizing employee wellbeing and improving the ergonomics of employees’ home offices. Women, parents and disabled persons may require extra support. © 2020, The Author(s).";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090966197&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-020-09875-y&partnerID=40&md5=019ff2c1ad602b82a95390ca6f5cb1fa";"scopus";"Ralph P., Baltes S., Adisaputri G., Torkar R., Kovalenko V., Kalinowski M., Novielli N., Yoo S., Devroey X., Tan X., Zhou M., Turhan B., Hoda R., Hata H., Robles G., Milani Fard A., Alkadhi R.";;;1;1;0;0;0;0;;0;0;;;;;2020;"Article";

Majority of the present software applications have software components as the basic elements, and component-based software development (CBSD) has been successful in building applications and systems. However, the security of CBS for the software component is still not properly noticed. Developing secure software is the accountability of all the stakeholders involved with component-based software development model. The main challenge is to access how much security we have achieved or how can we predict and evaluate the security at the early stage of software development? Software security has a very constructive impact on software productivity, maintainability, cost, and quality. Therefore, more early we introduce and evaluate security into component-based software more productivity and quality we can achieve. In this paper, efforts are done to provide some suitable guiding principle to the software engineers in the development of secure component-based software products.

Focus of every industry’s focus is on the improved utilization of the assets by improving machine productivity, automation, optimization which goes in hand in hand with the safer and environment friendly operation. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has wider application with advancement of various technologies – accuracy in geographical position system (GPS), high resolution digital camera, development of various sensors, processing power of computers and software development. Application of the unmanned arial vehicle (UAV) is one of such technology driven solution which is upcoming during last one decade to almost all mining and civil engineering projects of the performance improvements, reducing the cost of production, safe operating practices etc. Present paper focusses upon the implication of UAVs projects monitoring of the mining engineering projects.UAV is useful in exploration for preparation of topographical maps, identification of different rock types, airborne survey. UAV technology ensures the availability of miniature global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Number of critical situations during mining operation are handled with the ability of quick delivery of high temporal and spatial resolution image information. Digitized terrain models (DTM) are developed based on images captured by UAV which can be imported in autodesk or mine planning software – Surpac, Datamine etc. Various volumetric calculations can be done for OB removal, excavation, waste dump and stockpiles of minerals by measurement through photogrammetric method. With UAV advancement of faces can be monitored periodically. Due to the vastness of the modern mining engineering projects, the monitoring and control of different activities need the adoption of UAV based solutions on real time basis. The imagery and video acquired through UAV can be processed through photogrammetry software to develop two dimensional orthoimages and 3-dimensional surface models. The data acquired and products generated are fully compatible with AutoCAD and other civil 3D design software. Legal framework in very country is being formed. Legal implications and liability are to be examined. Project authorities for every project has to consider pros and cons before deployment of UAV technology.Location and movement of heavy earthmoving machinery is monitored including maintenance activities. Fragmentation of blasted rock, blast volume can be estimated with the support of UAV. Any hazardous work can be monitored remotely on UAV platform. During closure stage slope monitoring, reclamation of land which can be reviewed with the help of UAV.

"white";"Development of a just-in-time adaptive mhealth intervention for insomnia: Usability study";"Insomnia; IREST; JITAI; Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention; MHealth; Mobile health; Sleep; Smartphone; Usability";;"Background: Healthy sleep is a fundamental component of physical and brain health. Insomnia, however, is a prevalent sleep disorder that compromises functioning, productivity, and health. Therefore, developing efficient treatment delivery methods for insomnia can have significant societal and personal health impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is the recommended first-line treatment of insomnia but access is currently limited for patients, since treatment must occur in specialty sleep clinics, which suffer from an insufficient number of trained clinicians. Smartphone-based interventions offer a promising means for improving the delivery of CBTI. Furthermore, novel features such as real-time monitoring and assessment, personalization, dynamic adaptations of the intervention, and context awareness can enhance treatment personalization and effectiveness, and reduce associated costs. Ultimately, this “Just in Time Adaptive Intervention” for insomnia-an intervention approach that is acceptable to patients and clinicians, and is based on mobile health (mHealth) platform and tools-can significantly improve patient access and clinician delivery of evidence-based insomnia treatments. Objective: This study aims to develop and assess the usability of a Just in Time Adaptive Intervention application platform called iREST (“interactive Resilience Enhancing Sleep Tactics”) for use in behavioral insomnia interventions. iREST can be used by both patients and clinicians. Methods: The development of iREST was based on the Iterative and Incremental Development software development model. Requirement analysis was based on the case study's description, workflow and needs, clinician inputs, and a previously conducted BBTI military study/implementation of the Just in Time Adaptive Intervention architecture. To evaluate the usability of the iREST mHealth tool, a pilot usability study was conducted. Additionally, this study explores the feasibility of using an off-the-shelf wearable device to supplement the subjective assessment of patient sleep patterns. Results: The iREST app was developed from the mobile logical architecture of Just in Time Adaptive Intervention. It consists of a cross-platform smartphone app, a clinician portal, and secure 2-way communications platform between the app and the portal. The usability study comprised 19 Active Duty Service Members and Veterans between the ages of 18 and 60. Descriptive statistics based on in-app questionnaires indicate that on average, 12 (mean 12.23, SD 8.96) unique devices accessed the clinician portal per day for more than two years, while the app was rated as “highly usable”, achieving a mean System Usability Score score of 85.74 (SD 12.37), which translates to an adjective rating of “Excellent”. The participants also gave high scores on “ease of use and learnability” with an average score of 4.33 (SD 0.65) on a scale of 1 to 5. Conclusions: iREST provides a feasible platform for the implementation of Just in Time Adaptive Intervention in mHealth-based and remote intervention settings. The system was rated highly usable and its cross-platformness made it readily implemented within the heavily segregated smartphone market. The use of wearables to track sleep is promising; yet the accuracy of this technology needs further improvement. Ultimately, iREST demonstrates that mHealth-based Just in Time Adaptive Intervention is not only feasible, but also works effectively. © I Wayan Pulantara, Bambang Parmanto, Anne Germain.";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096028814&doi=10.2196%2fhumanfactors.8905&partnerID=40&md5=6f8537d3445c8243379013c2c8942e3e";"scopus";"Wayan Pulantara I., Parmanto B., Germain A.";;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;2018;"Article";

It has several benefits like scalability, reliability, increase in agility and productivity, resilience to failure, ease of deployment and maintenance, and decrease in time to market. Therefore, software companies have showed a tendency to transform architecture of their legacy applications from monoliths to microservice architecture. In this transformation process, software development teams face the challenge of migration of large applications to the new architecture, where understanding the current application and reusing existing code base are important. In this paper, we propose a new approach to transform existing applications into microservices using code repositories. We use evolutionary and static code coupling information, and the graph clustering methodology, in order to automatically extract microservices from monoliths.
